# WebChat Control Options

The webchat control does have a problem with a greedy focus. It is a known issue.

## Styling and Navigation options

### Activate based on an event

- Review the code at:
  - Views\Home\Index.cshtml

> **Note: ** This can get very sophisticated. The CSS could have a button floating on the screen and when the user presses a button it could open a dialog box to the left or right and then display the iframe. This demo provides a very simple implemetation.

### Navigate to another page

- Review the code at:
  - Controllers\Home\ShowBot
  - Views\Shared\_Layout.cshtml_
